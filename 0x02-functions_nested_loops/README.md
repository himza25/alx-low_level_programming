Task 0: The program prints _putchar, followed by a new line. Compiled using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
Task 1: The function prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Task 2: The function prints 10 times the alphabet in lowercase, each followed by a new line.
Task 3: The function checks if a character is lowercase.\n
Task 4: Function to check if character is alphabetic
Task 5: Function to print the sign of a number
Task 6: Function to compute absolute value of an integer
Task 7: Function to print the last digit of a number
Task 8: Function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer
Task 9: Function that prints the 9 times table
Task 10: Function that adds two integers
Task 11: Function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98
Task 12:The function print_times_table prints the n times table, starting with 0. If n is greater than 15 or less than 0, the function will not print anything.
Task 13: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. This program computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
Task14: This program prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.
