Task 0: In the first task, we will implement a function called 'malloc_checked' that allocates memory using malloc and handles allocation failures.
Task 1: This task is about creating a function that concatenates two strings. The function will allocate a new memory space that contains the first string, followed by the first n bytes of the second string. If n is greater or equal to the length of the second string, the entire second string will be used. If NULL is passed, it is treated as an empty string.
Task 2: This task is about creating a function that allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each using malloc and sets the memory to zero. If nmemb or size is 0, the function returns NULL. If malloc fails, the function also returns NULL.
