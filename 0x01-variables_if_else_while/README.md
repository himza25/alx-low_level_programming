This project involves assignments based on variables, if-else statements, and while loops in C programming language.

## 0-positive_or_negative.c

This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. It prints whether the number stored in the variable n is positive, negative, or zero.
The program 1-last_digit.c generates a random number and prints the last digit of the number along with a specific message based on the value of the last digit.
The program 2-print_alphabet.c prints the alphabet in lowercase using the putchar function only.
The program 3-print_alphabets.c prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase using the putchar function only.
The program 4-print_alphabt.c prints the alphabet in lowercase, skipping "e" and "q".
The program 5-print_numbers.c prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.
The program 6-print_numberz.c prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 without using any variable of type char.
