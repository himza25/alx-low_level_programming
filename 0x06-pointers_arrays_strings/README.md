Task 0: This repository contains the implementation of the _strcat function, which concatenates two strings.
Task 1: This repository now includes the implementation of the _strncat function, which concatenates up to n characters from the source string to the destination string.
Task 2: This repository now includes the implementation of the _strncpy function, which copies a string.
Task 3: This repository now includes the implementation of the _strcmp function, which compares two strings.
Task 4: This task is about writing a function that reverses the content of an array of integers. The function's prototype is 'void reverse_array(int *a, int n);' where 'n' is the number of elements of the array.
