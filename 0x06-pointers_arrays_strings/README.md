Task 0: This repository contains the implementation of the _strcat function, which concatenates two strings.
Task 1: This repository now includes the implementation of the _strncat function, which concatenates up to n characters from the source string to the destination string.
Task 2: This repository now includes the implementation of the _strncpy function, which copies a string.
Task 3: This repository now includes the implementation of the _strcmp function, which compares two strings.
Task 4: This task is about writing a function that reverses the content of an array of integers. The function's prototype is 'void reverse_array(int *a, int n);' where 'n' is the number of elements of the array.
Task 5: This task is about writing a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase. The function's prototype is 'char *string_toupper(char *);'
Task 6: This task is about writing a function that capitalizes all words of a string. The function's prototype is 'char *cap_string(char *);'
- Task 7: A function that encodes a string into 1337. Letters substitutions are as follows: a and A should be replaced by 4; e and E should be replaced by 3; o and O should be replaced by 0; t and T should be replaced by 7; l and L should be replaced by 1. The prototype of the function is 'char *leet(char *);'. The implementation is in '7-leet.c'.
